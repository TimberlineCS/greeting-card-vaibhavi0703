## Discussion

I started this project pretty late because I was really confused and I didnt know how to start my code. then I read the pdf for this project because i didnt really pay attention to the class.I was to busy completing my notes.so I started my code.First I made my background.

I wanted it to be hot pink but the color wasnt working at all. so I went to google and tried to hex color code but that wasnt working at all. so I decided to go with blue.the blue Iwanted was supposesd to be light blue but the light was rrally bad so I tried for turquoise. and it did work.wheni went o fire fox to see if my code worked ot not. it didnt so I was really worried and when i went back to my code I saw that my code was wrong.I forgot to append it.

After I made my bcakground I wanted to kind of text on my greeting card so I decided to add "merry Christmas" and I made in red color to macth the christmas vibe. Then I saw one of my friend added a background to the text to i decided to also add a background because it was really pretty.I made my background green color to make it more christmasy.

Then I was thinking to make a snowman. so I started making a small circle in white color. Then I decied to plae it on the right side of my screen.then for the body I copy pasted the same ode as the head of the snowman and I changed my position and and the size of my snowman. and thats how I made my snowman body. then I satrted writing a code for the eyes for my snowman. that was pretty easy cause I took the same code as a head then i changed the color, the raduis and also the position.

The I made 3 bottons for my snowman to make it look pretty. then I tried to make a top hat which took a while because I didnt knw the steps to write a code for the square but I eventually figured it out.

then I wrote a code for a polygon and I made 3 polygons. that was hard to position them. then i decied to make ornaments for my christmas tree. It was a lot of work and I deeid to make it in color full so it took a alot of time but it was worth it.

Then I had to add the song. I tried so hard to do it but it wanst working at all.I asked all of my friends to help me then one of them figured it out. there was a tying error. I made a mistake on spelling.

In the last I wanted to add a image or a gif to complete my last requirment . so i deceid to add snow flake gif. that was really easy.

## Extra Credit
